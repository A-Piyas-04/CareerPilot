> Derived from [`Problem-statement.md`](./Problem-statement.md)  
> Codebase audit: **May 29, 2026** (monorepo: Next.js 16 + FastAPI + Supabase + Gemini + JSearch)

## Legend

| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ✅ | Implemented and working in codebase |
| ⚠️ | Partially done, prototype, or needs refinement / upgrade |
| ❌ | Not implemented or missing vs. problem statement |

---

## Overall — Core Idea & Platform

| Item | Requirement / Constraint | Status | Notes |
|------|------------------------|--------|-------|
| Core idea | RAG over user's CV is single source of truth for all agents | ✅ | `resume_chunks` + pgvector; shared `rag_context_service` + `/api/v1/rag/context` |
| Core idea | No agent hallucinates user background | ⚠️ | Guardrails in assistant + CV answer prompts; quality depends on retrieval + user having uploaded CV |
| Platform | End-to-end agentic career co-pilot in one platform | ⚠️ | Four pillars largely present; Pillar 4 dashboard/nudges missing |
| Platform | Working web or mobile app | ✅ | Next.js web app; Docker Compose runnable |
| Platform | All four pillars implemented or prototyped | ⚠️ | Pillars 1–3 strong; Pillar 4 missing dashboard + AI nudges |

---

## Pillar 1 — Job Hunter Agent

| Item | Requirement / Constraint | Status | Notes |
|------|------------------------|--------|-------|
| Input | Natural-language job search (e.g. “ML internships in Dhaka”) | ✅ | `/jobs` search form → `POST /api/v1/jobs/search` |
| Output | Structured job cards | ⚠️ | Cards show role, company, location, fit score, skills, explanation; **salary & deadline not shown on UI** (backend has `salary_range`; JSearch rarely fills deadline) |
| Output | Role, company, salary range on card | ⚠️ | `salary_range` stored from JSearch; **not rendered** in `match-card.tsx` |
| Output | Application deadline on card | ❌ | `jobs.deadline` exists in schema; JSearch adapter does not map deadline |
| Output | Location on card | ✅ | Shown on match cards |
| Output | Fit score on card | ✅ | Programmatic badge (0–100) |
| Reasoning | Agent explains WHY each result matches (or doesn't), grounded in CV | ⚠️ | `explanation` + matched/missing skills from `job_scorer.py`; not a conversational agent narrative |
| Live search | At least one live search (job board API / scraping) | ✅ | JSearch via RapidAPI (`JSearchAdapter`) |
| External tools | Agent uses external tool calls (search API) | ✅ | `httpx` → JSearch; satisfies core technical requirement |
| Fit score | Computed programmatically (not LLM-only) | ✅ | `0.6 × skills_overlap + 0.4 × chunk_similarity` in `job_scorer.py` |
| Persistence | Search results stored | ✅ | `job_searches`, `jobs`, `job_matches` |
| Tracker link | Save match → application tracker | ✅ | `POST /matches/{id}/save` → Kanban `saved` |
| Manual JD | Paste job description for scoring | ⚠️ | `POST /api/v1/jobs/manual` + `addManualJob()`; **no UI form on `/jobs`** |

---

## Pillar 2 — Profile & Resume Intelligence (RAG Core)

| Item | Requirement / Constraint | Status | Notes |
|------|------------------------|--------|-------|
| Upload | PDF/DOCX CV upload | ✅ | `POST /api/v1/resumes/upload`; max 10 MB; pypdf + python-docx |
| In-app builder | Build CV directly inside platform | ✅ | `POST /api/v1/resumes/build`, `PUT .../build`; frontend builder + edit |
| Manual CV entry | Structured form → chunk → embed | ✅ | `POST /api/v1/resumes/manual`, `PUT .../manual`; `file_type: manual` |
| Chunking | CV chunked by section (experience, education, skills, projects) | ✅ | `section_detector.py` + `chunker.py` (900 char / 150 overlap) |
| Embedding | Chunks embedded and stored in vector DB | ✅ | Gemini embeddings → `resume_chunks` (pgvector) |
| Downstream RAG | Job matching, cover letters, gap analysis use this store | ✅ | Scorer, assistant, `career_generation_service` use RAG context |
| Semantic search | Query chunks by similarity | ✅ | `POST /api/v1/resumes/query` + RPC `match_resume_chunks` |
| Semantic search UI | Raw chunk search on `/resume` | ✅ | `ResumeQueryBox` — advanced collapsible panel with similarity scores |
| Grounded Q&A | Answer questions from CV with evidence | ✅ | `POST /api/v1/resumes/answer` + evidence UI on `/resume` |
| CV upload preview UI | Post-upload summary in drawer | ✅ | `resume-upload-preview-drawer.tsx` — sections/skills/chunk counts |
| CV section viewer UI | Full-screen section content | ✅ | `resume-section-viewer-drawer.tsx` |
| CV delete confirm UI | Professional delete dialog | ✅ | `resume-delete-dialog.tsx` |
| Skills extraction | Skills indexed from CV | ✅ | Gemini + regex fallback → `user_skills` |
| Vector ops risk | Embedding dimension alignment (384 vs 768) | ⚠️ | App defaults 768 (Gemini); migrations/RPC may be 384 — Alembic `embedding_new` path; must align in deployment |
| File storage | Raw CV in object storage | ❌ | `file_url` column unused; text-only pipeline |
| Scanned PDFs | OCR for image-only PDFs | ❌ | Empty text → 422 (documented out of scope) |

| Memory | Conversational memory within a session | ✅ | `loadConversationMemory` — last 12 messages per conversation |
| Persistence | Conversations & messages saved | ✅ | `assistant_conversations`, `assistant_messages` |
| Query | “Am I ready for this data engineer role?” → verdict + reasoning | ✅ | `readiness_check` intent + grounded prompts |
| Query | “What skills am I missing for a Google internship?” → skill gap | ⚠️ | Chat intent + `POST /api/v1/career/skill-gap/analyze`; **no dedicated UI page** |
| Query | “Build me a 3-month roadmap…” → weekly plan + resources | ✅ | `/roadmap` generate + detail timeline; chat **Save Roadmap**; items → task/calendar APIs |
| Query | “Draft a cover letter…” → personalized from real experience | ✅ | `/cover-letters` studio (generate, edit, regenerate) + chat save path |
| Cover letter metadata | Job title, company, tone, JD stored on letter | ✅ | `cover_letters` columns + Pydantic models; migration `20260529000000` |
| Roadmap ↔ resume | Roadmap linked to active CV | ✅ | `roadmaps.resume_id` FK; generate form can pass resume |
| RAG grounding | Responses grounded in actual CV chunks | ✅ | RAG context in system prompt; `ChunkEvidenceCard` in chat when chunks used |
| Hallucination guard | No CV → explicit warning, no invented background | ✅ | Banners + system prompt guards in `route.ts` |
| LLM | Uses external LLM (Gemini) | ✅ | `createGeminiStream` in Next.js route handler |
| Intent routing | Benchmark query types detected | ✅ | Rules + Gemini classifier in `detectIntent.ts` |

## Recommended Next Actions (priority)

1. ❌ **Progress dashboard** — applications/week, skills count, roadmap %, streak (Pillar 4 + required feature #8).
2. ❌ **AI nudges** — cron or on-login prompt using recent matches + application gap (Pillar 4).
3. ⚠️ **Job cards** — display `salary_range`; map/show deadline when API provides it.
4. ⚠️ **README + architecture diagram** — update stack/env vars; add one diagram for judges (deliverable 4.2).
5. ❌ **Evaluation suite bonus** — seed 5+ rows in `evaluation_tests` or markdown doc with pass/fail.
6. ❌ **5-minute demo video** — record full required flow (deliverable 4.3).
7. ❌ **Live deployment** — Vercel + Railway/Render with env vars (bonus).
8. ⚠️ **pgvector dimension** — align RPC/column with 768-dim Gemini before judging.
9. ⚠️ **Manual job paste UI** on `/jobs` for fit score without JSearch.
10. ❌ **Skill gap dedicated page** — chat/API only; roadmaps + cover letters now have full UI.
11. ⚠️ **Landing page** — list Job Hunter + Roadmap alongside Cover Letter Studio on `/`.
